# PingandLog
In short:

It's a ping test tool that:

    Pings a target (hostname or IP address) continuously for a user-specified amount of time.

    Calculates average ping, jitter (variation in ping times), and counts ping failures.

    Saves results to a CSV file only if there are more than 2 ping failures.
